> Recommendations on how to get started with Python as a first programming language up to using PyGame

This repo intends to help someone unfamiliar with computer programming by providing suggestions for the following topics.

Topic|Description
-----|-----------
[First Programming Language Options](./docs/00-first-prog-lang-opts.md)|While there are a lot of good programming languages in existence today, here I show why I believe Python is the best first programming language for someone who desires to build games.
[Setup Environment](./docs/01-setup-env.md)|In this section we will discover the software we need to install to write programs with Python and setup the environment needed for the examples in this repo.
[Jupyter Notebooks](./docs/02-jupyter-notebooks.md)|One of the features of the Python extension for VS Code is so called Jupyter Notebooks. In this section we will explore using Jupyter Notebooks to incrementally learn a new programming topic.
[Basics of Programming](./docs/03-basics-of-prog.md)|This section introduces the basic concepts involved in computer programming or software engineering as it is also known.
[Writing Games](./docs/04-writing-games.md)|Writing games is a vast and broad topic. In this section we will explore how we can apply some of the things we have learned so far to the art form of game development.
[PyGame](./docs/05-pygame.md)|Let's take a look at PyGame as one of the most popular libraries for writing games in Python.
[Next Steps](./docs/06-next-steps.md)|What else? Since Python is arguably the most popular general purpose programming languages in use today there are a lot of resources to expand our knowledge of Python ans how it might be used.
