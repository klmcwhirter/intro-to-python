## First Programming Language Options
While there are a lot of good programming languages in existence today, here I show why I believe Python is the best first programming
language for someone who desires to build games.

Also, there are several widely referred to surveys about the popular languages. Take them all with a grain of salt, but these are some of the most common.

Survey|Comments
------|--------
[Stackoverflow - Learning to Code](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-other)|Annual survey by stackoverflow.com based on participants' profiles and questions asked on the platform
[TIOBE 2024 survey](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)|The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
[IEEE 2023 survey](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-top-programming-languages-2023)|Combines multiple metrics of popularity into a set of rankings that reflect the varying needs of different readers
[Forbes end of 2022 survey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/12/28/what-your-software-partner-should-know-the-top-programming-languages-of-2023/?sh=623b0612182b)|Wrapping up 2022, but looking forward to end 2023 shows Python as the #1 language
[hackr.io 2024 survey for games](https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-language-for-games)|best programming languages for game development in 2024 - all skill levels! Not just beginner; Python is at the top of their list for programmers just starting to learn

## Options
How do you choose a good language with which to get started?

The best approach is to not try to reinvent the wheel, so to speak. You can apply knowledge from developers who have gone before you by asking yourself questions like these?

> What languages are people using to write the kind of software I am looking to write?

> What languages are extensible but are simple to use at first?

> What languages offer the most resources for me to get help?

> What languages have the largest communities of developers?

### High-level Programming Languages
High-level programming languages simplify the task of interacting with the computer by providing abstractions that hide things like managing memory. This makes it easier to get started using them because those detailed aspects of computer usage are not needed to be known as a programmer gets started.

Here are some examples.

Language|Good for...
--------|-----------
Python|Literally any general purpose task
Javascript/HTML/CSS|These languages are typically used together to build web apps
PHP/HTML/CSS|Also used together to build web apps
Bash/Shell|Used to automate sequences of commands; orchestrate multi-step OS tasks - e.g., copy images from a folder and convert them to a specific format and/or resolution

### Lower-level Programming Languages
Language|Good for...
--------|-----------
C/C++|System level programs (services) or software that needs direct access to hardware (games or data processing apps needing direct and fine grained access to GPUs)
Assembly|For lowest level control of the parts of a computer (CPU, GPU, memory access units, etc.) - can be the highest performing but most complex to use
C#/Java|Could also be considered a medium-level set of languages, but definitely not high-level; need to understand the nuances of their VMs to use effectively
go/rust/zig|Modern low-level languages that are very widely used today

## Conclusions
As you saw above, Python is arguably the most popular programming language in the world.

It also:
- is simple to learn - use only the features you need to get started. Add features as you learn more.
- is a general-purpose programming language - this means it will grow with you as your skills increase and can be used for a wide ranging of programming tasks
- is multi-paradigm - not important now, but Python supports procedural, functional and object-oriented programming paradigms
- used for every part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) - Python is used not only for software development but also for system maintenance, testing, code and data generation tasks
- has a huge community
- has a vast ecosystem of related libraries, tools, learning materials, etc.

See this short YouTube video for a very brief overview.
