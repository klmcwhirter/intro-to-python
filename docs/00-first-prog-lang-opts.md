## First Programming Language Options
While there are a lot of good programming languages in existent today, here I show why I believe Python is the best first programming
language for someone who desires to build games.

Also, there are several widely referred to surveys about the popular languages. Take them all with a grain of salt, but these are some of the most common.

[Stackoverflow - Learning to Code](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-language-other)|Annual survey by stackoverflow.com based on participants' profiles and questions asked on the platform
[TIOBE 2024 survey](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)|The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written.
