# intro-to-python

## Setup Environment
In this section we will discover the software we need to install to write programs with Python and setup the environment needed for the examples in this repo.

To get started programming in Python you will need the following.

* Python runtime - distribution containing the Python language interpreter, related tools and the standard library
* Programmer's Editor or IDE - we will be using Visual Studio Code as the most common
* Python Extension for VS Code - provides language services, debugger, Jupyter Notebook support to VS Code
* Git source code control tool - this will allow you to download the repo in which we are working locally so you have all of these docs and the examples as they are created.

And that is all!

## Python Runtime
The latest stable Python Runtime is version 3.12.1 and is available at [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Simply download the installer and run it on your system. _It should prompt you for admin credentials._

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code
The latest stable version of VS Code is currently 1.85 and is available at [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Python Extension
The Python Extension for VS Code enables many language supporting features we will need.

To install it: make sure VS Code is installed and running and then follow the instructions at [Quick Start Guide for Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-quick-start).

## Git
The latest stable version of git is 2.43.0 and is available at [Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Just click on the "Click here to download" link at the top to get the installer. After downloaded run the installer.

Restart VS Code if it is running.

_There is no need to install a GUI. We will be using the git support built into VS Code._

## Git support in VS Code

To get started with git in VS Code see - [Using Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview).

There are a few pretty good videos referenced on that page. But ...

_Source code control is a very large topic. Most of the concepts you will not need until later - if ever._

Don't worry about understanding the details for now. We will talk through them at the right time. I will guide you to get exposed to the concepts as you need them.

## Clone this repo

Then clone this repo using the instructions at [Open a Git repository](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_open-a-git-repository).

> NOTE! You do NOT need a github.com account to use the git features in VS Code to clone the repo.
Enter this URL when asked for the repo URL: https://github.com/klmcwhirter/intro-to-python

Then it will ask for a folder into which it should clone the repo. A wise choice is a short path from your home directory.

On Windows that might be something like `%USERPROFILE%\src`.

Make sure there are no spaces in any of the directory names. For example, do not use `My Documents`.

_On Linux, I use `$HOME/src/github.com/klmcwhirter` because I work with so many repos. That way I know I will never have a naming conflict with any repo I clone whether from github.com, gitlab.com, etc._

But you need not worry about that for now. Just be aware there is an easy solution if and when you run into the problem.
