## Setup Environment
In this section we will discover the software we need to install to write programs with Python and setup the environment needed for the examples in this repo.

To get started programming in Python you will need the following.

* Python runtime - distribution containing the Python language interpreter, related tools and the standard library
* Programmer's Editor or IDE - we will be using Visual Studio Code as the most common
* Python Extension for VS Code - provides language services, debugger, Jupyter Notebook support to VS Code
* Git source code control tool - this will allow you to download the repo in which we are working locally so you have all of these docs and the examples as they are created.

And that is all!

## Python Runtime
The latest stable Python Runtime is version 3.12.1 and is available at [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Simply download the installer and run it on your system. _It should prompt you for admin credentials._

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code
The latest stable version of VS Code is currently 1.85 and is available at [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Python Extension
The Python Extension for VS Code enables many language supporting features we will need.

To install it: make sure VS Code is installed and running and then follow the instructions at [Quick Start Guide for Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-quick-start).

## Git
The latest stable version of git is 2.43.0 and is available at [Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Just click on the "Click here to download" link at the top to get the installer. After downloaded run the installer.

Restart VS Code if it is running.

_There is no need to install a GUI. We will be using the git support built into VS Code._
